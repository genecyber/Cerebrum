[15:15:21][Fault] Nope.

[17:40:20][Swstrangla] k, let me run to grab the wood then I'll mail this to my warlock and run to brill
[17:40:56][Swstrangla] I'll try to make up some bags for you in a bit, not sure how much NW i have on hand
[17:41:39][Swstrangla] eh, you can level faster if you aren't running back to the vendor every 3 minutes
[17:41:42][Swstrangla] :-P
[17:41:47][Swstrangla] and netherweave is cheap as dog spit
"[16:56:41][Akána] Hi. Wanna join the new guild "Quarti Storm"?"
[00:47:36][Aloldin] yo were do i go to get gear?
[02:20:54][Wisperer] I was thinking that I would like to get together with u and have a tutorial session to set up herbing
[12:25:28][Daelane] yes because I am doing the quests for faction
[19:05:46][Insurgence] hey good.  I tried out the modem and there is a dhcp server in mine too.
[19:06:04][Insurgence] could u use one of those services that hide ur ip?
[19:06:39][Insurgence] u tried it?
[19:20:00][Insurgence] not yet.
[19:20:46][Insurgence] I am not sure that warden would know that ur using a proxy server, and I am not sure it would matter.
[19:21:03][Insurgence] can u lvl a toon yet?
[19:21:37][Insurgence] that is very sophistocated
[19:22:01][Insurgence] have u got a toon to 70 yet?
[19:22:19][Insurgence] yep!
[19:22:58][Insurgence] don't log out and try logging back in.  my son can't logg in right now
[19:24:51][Insurgence] do quests?
[19:25:30][Insurgence] I could go in a couple of days this week and work on it
[19:27:34][Insurgence] grinding might be easier than questing
[19:28:39][Insurgence] to lvl, grinding would be easier to set up than doing a bunch of quests
[19:29:28][Insurgence] ya, like between 66-70 farming motes of fire
[19:29:47][Insurgence] between 63-57 farming basklisk
[19:29:59][Insurgence] 63-67
[19:31:38][Insurgence] could get it up and running with some farming and refine it as time goes on to  do more quests
[19:32:19][Insurgence] a SP with ok gear can kill them with dots as fast as u can walk
[19:33:40][Insurgence] when we were lvl'ng ppl that ground lvl'd about the same speed as questers.  Instances seemed to be faster
[19:34:01][Insurgence] but I am sure that ppl have tested it out and I bet ur right
[19:34:22][Insurgence] so setting up a quest database might be the way to go.  
[19:34:46][Insurgence] I am familar with a lot of quests, having done them twice myself and with my kids
[19:35:09][Insurgence] ya, I have read about that.
[19:35:37][Insurgence] they must have lists that tell u which quests give the most xp per time to do.
[19:36:45][Insurgence] I would expect that questers are harder to catch
[19:37:10][Insurgence] automate the dailies too
[19:37:53][Insurgence] 11G per quest and u can do 10 max each day
[19:39:49][Insurgence] takes me about 90 min to do mine
[19:42:09][Insurgence] and it is mindless
[19:44:44][Insurgence] ya, I  do dailies just because there is a bit of varierty
[19:46:25][Insurgence] there is one where u lasso mana rays.  I like to watch hordies getting them down to low lvl and then killing them before they can be lasso'd
[19:47:38][Insurgence] ya, I do it just for entertainment
[19:57:30][Insurgence] that is crap
[19:58:13][Insurgence] u can pick it up faster from the mailbox
[19:58:54][Insurgence] switching onto wisp
[20:00:55][Wisperer] they told me my max was 6 mb on my line
[20:01:24][Wisperer] might go and try mining motes to see how much per hour I get.
[20:01:38][Wisperer] give me a location to farm and I will try it.
[20:01:49][Wisperer] anything to farm
[20:02:28][Wisperer] ....
[20:02:49][Wisperer] and do what?
[20:03:10][Wisperer] farm them for what?
[20:03:22][Wisperer] signets
[20:23:56][Wisperer] yes
[20:24:14][Wisperer] nice
[20:25:00][Wisperer] good idea
[18:13:18][Scalden] hey

[22:41:08][Shadøw] lvls
